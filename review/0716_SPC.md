## Single-agent framework
* frameworks
  * langgraph
* workflow
  * if we define prompt really well and pass the right set of tools, we don't need workflow
  * later on LLM can be better at designing workflows, we don't need workflow
  * or at least workflow
    * we don't need that many different types of workflows
    * since by doing that, we are just implementing a hard coded rule, it's not really agentic!

## Multi-agent framework
* frameworks
  * metagpt
  * autogen
  * crewai
  * langgraph multi agent
* designs
* types of tasks
  * brainstorming, discussion
  * collaboratively finish some task
    * can be replaced by one single agent, if we define the prompt really well
* demos


## Proposed framework
* One main agent, hierarchical agent management, sub-agent in charge of a specific task
  * one main agent, where we use information collection agent as a tool
  * information collection agent, only has websearch tool
