## Single-agent framework
* frameworks
  * langgraph
* workflow
  * if we define prompt really well and pass the right set of tools, we don't need workflow
  * later on LLM can be better at designing workflows, we don't need workflow
  * or at least workflow
    * we don't need that many different types of workflows
    * since by doing that, we are just implementing a hard coded rule, it's not really agentic!

## Multi-agent framework
* frameworks
  * metagpt
  * autogen
  * crewai
  * langgraph multi agent
    * https://github.com/PathOnAI/MultiAgent/blob/main/scratch/fake_multi_agent/research_plot.py
    * https://github.com/PathOnAI/MultiAgent/blob/main/scratch/fake_multi_agent/coding.py
* designs
* types of tasks
  * brainstorming, discussion
    * this type of demos look cool, but it's essentially a group of agents taking turns to chat
  * collaboratively finish some task
    * can be replaced by one single agent, if we define the prompt really well
* demos
  * what is the real use case?


## Proposed framework
* One main agent, hierarchical agent management, sub-agent in charge of a specific task
  * one main agent, where we use information collection agent as a tool
    * information collection agent can be a workflow-based agent
    * general agent is still general, and use that workflow based agent as a tool
  * information collection agent, only has websearch tool
    * if it's one step, very straight-forward, what about multiple steps?
    * still works? no tool calling, then the task is finished for the sub agent???
* demos
