# Design Document: Hierarchical AI Agents Open-Source Project

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop an open-source framework for creating and managing hierarchical AI agents. This system will allow for the creation of complex, multi-level agent structures where higher-level agents can utilize lower-level agents as tools to accomplish tasks.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Create a flexible and extensible hierarchical agent framework
- Implement a system for agent communication and task delegation
- Develop a mechanism for agents to use other agents as tools
- Ensure scalability to support multiple levels of agent hierarchy
- Provide an intuitive API for developers to create and manage agents
- Foster an open-source community around hierarchical AI agents
