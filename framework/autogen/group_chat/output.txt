Title: Snake Game Design for 9*9 Screen Device

Scope Requirement:

1. User Interface (UI):
   - The game should be designed for a 9*9 screen grid.
   - The game must display the current score and high score at all times.
   - The game should ensure optimal use of the grid with the snake, apple, and boundaries clearly defined.
   - User should have controls to navigate the snake in the grid.

2. Game Flow:
   - Upon game start, the snake must spawn at a random location.
   - The apple (snakeâ€™s food) should generate at a random location.
   - The game ends when the snake hits the grid boundary or collides with its own body.

3. Game Mechanics:
   - The snake should move continuously in the mapped direction.
   - The snake length should increase by one grid after consuming an apple.
   - An eaten apple should immediately spawn in another random location.
   - The speed of the snake should gradually increase as the score goes up to increase difficulty.

4. Scoring Criteria:
   - For every apple consumed by the snake, the user should earn points.
   - The score should reset to zero at the start of every new game.
   - High score should be retained and displayed.

5. Compatibility:
   - The snake game should be compatible and optimally viewable in the given device frame.

6. User Experience:
   - The game controls should be easy to understand and operate.
   - The game should provide an option to restart the game after it ends.

Technical Requirements:

- Preferred Languages: Python/Java (Use of game development library like Pygame/Slick2D is required for respective languages)
- Database: Not Required
- UI: ASCII graphics or Basic 2D Sprites
- Testing: Unit Testing with inbuilt Testing framework

This general overview captures the basic functions of the game. The project can be expanded with features like different game modes, online leaderboards, etc. in the future.

To implement the Snake game based on the requirements specified, we can use Python `curses` library which is used for creating GUI in the console. The code provided below will create a Snake game for a 9*9 screen size. The gamer can play the game using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

```python
# filename: snake_game.py

import random
import curses

s = curses.initscr()
curses.curs_set(0)
sh, sw = s.getmaxyx()
w = curses.newwin(sh, sw, 0, 0)
w.keypad(1)
w.timeout(100)

snk_x = sw//4
snk_y = sh//2
snake = [
    [snk_y, snk_x],
    [snk_y, snk_x-1],
    [snk_y, snk_x-2]
]

food = [sh//2, sw//2]
w.addch(food[0], food[1], curses.ACS_PI)

score = 0

key = curses.KEY_RIGHT

while True:
    next_key = w.getch()
    key = key if next_key == -1 else next_key

    if snake[0][0] in [0, sh] or \
        snake[0][1]  in [0, sw] or \
        snake[0] in snake[1:]:
        curses.endwin()
        quit()

    new_head = [snake[0][0], snake[0][1]]

    if key == curses.KEY_DOWN:
        new_head[0] += 1
    if key == curses.KEY_UP:
        new_head[0] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_LEFT:
        new_head[1] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_RIGHT:
        new_head[1] += 1

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    if snake[0] == food:
        score += 1
        food = None
        while food is None:
            nf = [
                random.randint(1, sh-1),
                random.randint(1, sw-1)
            ]
            food = nf if nf not in snake else None
        w.addch(food[0], food[1], curses.ACS_PI)
    else:
        tail = snake.pop()
        w.addch(tail[0], tail[1], ' ')

    w.addch(snake[0][0], snake[0][1], curses.ACS_CKBOARD)
```

Please note: To play the game, you need to make sure that your terminal window size is at least 9*9.

To run the game, save the content in a file named `snake_game.py` and then execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python snake_game.py
```

Please note that `curses` is a Unix-based library. If you're working on Windows, you need to install a Windows version of the curses library using the following command:

```sh
pip install windows-curses
```
