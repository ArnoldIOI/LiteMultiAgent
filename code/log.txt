Forbes Vetted Following Aug 10, 2023, 04:03pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin When it comes to seeking out the best dining tables on the market, buyers tend to scout for options that can withstand the test of time and serve as a statement piece in their dining space. What’s more, dining tables often serve as makeshift work spaces for many families. Indeed, their value is critical and more than aesthetic. For that reason, as with couches and so many other large pieces of furniture, it’s important to consider how the table will work for your daily needs, and coalesce with the rest of your home. Our top choice for a dining table in 2023 is the Wrought Studio Archambeault Pedestal Dining Table . It’s both reasonably priced, nice to look a and it ships quickly, too, but we’ve found many other great options to consider as well. One of the best dining tables on the market in 2023 is this stunner from Birch Lane, which is roomy ... [+] enough for family meals and celebrations. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailers Before you buy, it pays to think about how you might use your table on a daily basis. If you’re always throwing dinner parties, hosting holidays or simply serving up casual meals to your family on weeknights, you already know the importance of a great dining table. But it’s not all about mealtime: Parents know the value of a roomy table when it comes to late-night homework sessions and family game nights. The best dining tables can quickly become the social hub of your home, making it that much more important to purchase one that’s comfortable, built to last and aligns with your aesthetic. Ahead, we’ve rounded up our favorites right now, including extendable dining tables, round dining tables and ones for small spaces, too. Best Dining Table Overall: Wrought Studio Archambeault Pedestal Dining Table Best Round Dining Table: Raymour & Flanigan Lucy Round Dining Table Best Budget Dining Table: Zinus Louis Modern Studio Collection Soho Dining Table with Two Benches Best Small Dining Table: Castlery Miles Dining Table Best Extendable Dining Table: Crate & Barrel Lakin Teak Extendable Dining Table Best Farmhouse Dining Table: Birch Lane Dining Table Best Midcentury Dining Table: Modloft Liam Dining Table Best Dining Table Overall A Popular Table That Ships In Days Wayfair Wrought Studio Archambeault 51.25'' Pedestal Dining Table Shop At Wayfair If you’re seeking a new dining table that’s more sleek and modern, you’re in luck. The Wrought Studio Archambeault Pedestal Dining Table from Wayfair is our “best overall” pick, earning high marks for its durability, beauty and excellent price. At under $500, it’s a relative bargain, and several color combinations are offered to accompany the gleaming glass top. The table ships in a matter of days to many stateside locations, too. Finally, hundreds of excellent reviews add to its appeal, with several customers noting that the table comes “packaged securely,” that the glass is “thick” and “durable” and that it’s easy to put together. Best Budget Dining Table An Under-$200 Beauty With Included Seating Amazon Zinus Louis Modern Studio Collection Soho Dining Table With Two Benches Shop At Amazon Those working with a budget should be aware that there are plenty of well-priced tables on the market these days, including ones that come with seating. We particularly like this dining table from Zinus. Not only is it incredibly stylish in its simplicity, but it also  comes with two handy benches included. A durable steel frame and an enormous number of glowing reviews make it even more worth your while, as does its under-$200 price and solid construction. Best Small Dining Table An Option That Can Tuck Into Even The Smallest Apartments Castlery Miles Dining Table Shop At Castlery Dining tables that extend beyond 60 inches are practical for many bigger families, but they make small dining rooms feel a little tight. Luckily, this option from Castlery, which comes in at a solid 59 inches, is roomy enough to fit a full four people working well for smaller spaces. Rendered in solid wood with steel-rod bracing beneath, it’s incredibly durable and handsome, too. We can see why reviewers can’t stop singing its praises. Best Extendable Dining Table An Extendable Table From A Quality Brand Crate & Barrel Lakin 81-Inch Teak Extendable Dining Table Shop At Crate & Barrel If your house is the place to be for parties, holidays, and family gatherings, then you may want to consider investing in an extendable dining table. Crate & Barrel’s Lakin Teak table is an excellent option: With industrial-style legs and a solid wood apron, it’s bound to work well with most décor styles. The table also features two leaves that can be added to expand its seating count to eight or even more. Best Round Dining Table A Splurge-Worthy Option For Smaller Households Raymour & Flanigan Lucy 48" Round Dining Table Shop At Raymour & Flanigan If you’re looking for a petite table with Parisian flair, look no further: This round option features a cast-iron pedestal, a stunning white marble top and French industrial details. Parents of young children should take note, though, that it’s a little more difficult to clean than some of the other options on our list; you’ll need to clean up any spills immediately in order to avoid staining the marble. At just 48 inches wide, it’s an ideal choice for smaller households. Best Farmhouse Dining Table The Stuff Of Parisian Flea Market Dreams Birch Lane Kinston Dining Table Shop At Birch Lane While Joanna Gaines may be able to pick up a bygone farmhouse table at one of the many flea markets she frequents, you may not have the time for such a venture. If that’s the case, never fear: You can opt for a new table that looks as if it’s been pulled from an early 20th century farmhouse. Birch Lane’s Kinston table is a robust, solid piece with stunning legs and molded accents that give it a time-worn feel in the best way possible. Best Midcentury Dining Table A Simple Option That Still Offers Plenty of Character Room & Board Modloft Liam Dining Table Shop At Modloft When looking for a midcentury design, angled legs and a walnut finish, along with a sleek, no-frills design is a telltale sign that you’ve hit the jackpot. This table from Modloft fits the bill, and it’s fresh and current enough for today’s homes, too. With seven wood options available and plenty of size options, you’ll be able to comfortably fit your whole family. MORE FROM FORBES VETTED The Best Lightweight Laptops To Carry With You All Day Long By Jon Martindale Contributor Achieve Better Sleep With The Best Firm Mattress For Back Pain By Alison Barretta Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted editors have years of experience scouting out the best home products on the market, and we’ve published dozens of stories on the subject, including firsthand tested reviews of patio furniture , large kitchen appliances and more. For this story, we spent ample time researching customer reviews, scouring the sites of popular retailers and generally hunting down the best dining tables on the market. What’s more, we refresh this story regularly to ensure that all of our picks are in-stock and up-to-date; it was last updated in August 2023. Which Is The Best Dining Table Brand? There are so many excellent dining table options on the market right now, and brands like Pottery Barn , Crate and Barrel and Wayfair all offer a plethora of models at reasonable prices. That said, our top pick is the Wrought Studio Archambeault 51.25'' Pedestal Dining Table . It’s sleek, modern and durable—and all for under $500. What’s more, the table ships in just a few days (depending on where you are in the world), and reviewers claim it’s easy to put together. What Type Of Dining Table Is Most Durable? For hundreds of years, people have been crafting and using solid wood dining tables, and the material has stood the test of time: It’s still a coveted option when it comes to modern tables. Wood is easy enough to repair, and it’s strong and sturdy, too. (Marble is popular at the moment, but it’s much more difficult to clean, and metal tables can get dented.) How Much Does A Quality Dining Room Table Cost? The best solid wood dining tables can run over $1,000, depending on size. That said, there are thousands of lower-priced tables available (in fact, some are as low as $150). And as manufacturing processes improve, these “budget” tables are actually relatively durable. Remember, quality varies from brand to brand and from table to table, so you’d be wise to check out the specifics on every model before making a purchase.

Shopping for the best dining room tables, and furniture in general, can be overwhelming, especially online. The options are seemingly endless, and a table is one of the most important pieces of furniture you can buy—it’s right up there with a bed and a couch or sectional. It’s the heart of many homes, and in some, it also doubles as a desk, craft station, command center, and more. But if you’re in the market for a modern dining table, I’ve gone down the online furniture shopping rabbit hole for you. These are some of the most stylish, well-built dining tables you can have shipped straight to your door, no matter the size of your space or your budget. There’s even a real wood dining table for six that you can get for less than $500. So, whether you want natural wood, shiny lacquer, or real marble, here are 13 of the best dining room tables to buy in 2023—including the one I have at home right now. Go straight to shopping our top dining tables, or jump to a section: An inexpensive wooden table: Hearth and Hand Black Wood Dining Table, $450 at Target , or jump to shop more rectangular tables . A round postmodern dining table: Daymon Dining Table, $2,480 at Wayfair , or jump to shop more round tables . An oval solid-wood dining table: Anton Solid Wood Dining Table $1,499 at West Elm , or jump to shop more oval tables . What to consider when buying a dining table . Rectangular dining tables A statement table for smaller dining spaces My husband and I have been through four dining tables since we purchased our smallish Arts & Crafts bungalow a decade ago, and Article’s Dako table finally feels like the one. We knew we wanted a table with enough visual weight to match the home’s original interior trim, but we also wanted something modern that felt more timeless than trendy. Practically speaking, we also needed it to be super sturdy and durable enough to stand up to our two kids. The Dako checks all those boxes, and at 77 inches long it comfortably seats six to eight people while still tucking nicely into one side of our not-so-stately dining room. It’s a few inches deeper than standard dining tables, too, which means the tabletop never feels crowded, even when we’re having a dinner party. Design-wise, the clean lines make it versatile enough to work with a variety of home decor styles (including my eclectic maximalist one). Article also offers white-glove delivery service, which means your table will be carried inside and assembled so you don’t have to lift a finger (the delivery people also take all the packing materials with them when they go!). The only negative I’ve experienced with this table is that the natural white oak wood top tends to highlight grease spots and spills, but honestly, that just forces me to wipe it down more often—which is actually a good thing. Size(s) available: 77" x 39" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Dako White Oak Dining Table $1,199 Article A low-profile burl wood stunner Dark burl wood is having a moment (and has been for a few years ). This low-profile dining table from CB2 features just the right amount of the dramatic wood grain to elevate any dining space. And because it has both clean lines and classic curves, it would work in a modern, minimalist home but it would also be a beautiful addition to a more traditional or eclectic room. Size(s) available: 72" x 36", 100" x 36" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Aqua Virgo Rectangular Dark Burl Wood Dining Table $999 CB2 A midcentury-inspired wood dining table for small spaces Furniture brand Zinus may be best known (especially on Amazon) for its sturdy bed frames and affordable memory foam mattresses, but the company makes other pieces too. This compact real-wood table has a similar look to the Smiley (above), but with a much smaller footprint—and price tag. And because it’s compact, it could also work as a desk . Reviewers have called the Zinus Jen “the best dining table I’ve ever bought,” “the best assembly experience I’ve ever had,” and “one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on Amazon.” Size(s) available: 47" x 29" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Zinus Jen 47 Inch Wood Dining Table $205 Amazon $235 $132 Walmart A rustic modern farmhouse table for small spaces If you’re working with a small space and budget , but you still want something that feels both rustic and modern, this 54-inch modern farmhouse dining table has great reviews. It’s made of solid wood and can seat up to six people. You can get matching benches , too, but for a more considered look, pair it with a collection of mismatched chairs. Size(s) available: 59" x 36" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Better Homes & Gardens Bryant Solid Wood Dining Table $262 $229 Walmart A ritzy glass dining table Glass-top dining tables are not for everyone. They’re not even for most people. But for those whose lifestyle and interior design aesthetic allows for such a fragile piece of furniture, there’s no point in hiding the glass top behind (or buried within) a bunch of bulky framing. This table is available in a few different colors, but I really love the contrast of the glass top and antique brass legs. Size(s) available: 80" x 44", 104" x 44" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Mercer Rectangular Dining Table $2,595 Williams Sonoma A simple black dining table under $500 This rubberwood table from Target’s Hearth & Hand line has a timeless silhouette, a modern (albeit slightly distressed) black finish, and an affordable price tag. At 72 inches long, it comfortably seats six, and reviews from verified purchasers indicate that this is a sturdy dining table that’s super easy to assemble. Size(s) available: 72" x 32" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Hearth & Hand with Magnolia Black Wood Dining Table $450 Target An extendable farmhouse table Extendable dining tables offer incredible versatility, but the leaves (even if they’re hidden) can take away from the overall look of the piece. Not so with this modern farmhouse table from Pottery Barn. It’s cleverly designed so the top is one solid piece, and the extension leaves tuck up under the ends so they’re entirely out of sight when not in use. This sturdy table is a modern but rustic statement piece made of kiln-dried mango and acacia wood, and it’s available in four colors and two sizes. Size(s) available: 73" to 97" x 33", 83" to 115" x 33" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Reed Extending Dining Table $999 Pottery Barn A neon green dining table Hear me out: When your space is missing something and you just can’t figure out what that something is, it just might be a pop of neon. And that’s especially true for well-styled spaces that have a light or dark monochromatic vibe. Though big enough to seat six comfortably, this durable indoor-outdoor table has a low-enough profile that the neon green color won’t dominate your dining room, but it will add instant personality. It says, “See? I can be fun…when I want to be.” Just be sure you don’t go overboard with the neon, either. For example, you can get matching green dining chairs to make it a whole dining set, but doing so would instantly make it look more outdoorsy and less interesting. Instead, pair this colorful table with more neutral chairs in a contrasting color or material. Size(s) available: 71" x 35" More color/finish options: Yes (depending on retailer) Extendable: No Hokku Designs Ballista Dining Table $1,240 $940 Wayfair $1,030 All Modern A compact drop-leaf dining table If you’re really short on space but want a small dining table that doesn’t look like it belongs in someone’s first apartment, this drop-leaf table has industrial black steel legs and a kiln-dried wood top. It even has adjustable levelers so it will be stable on uneven floors (bet your first dining table didn’t have those). With the leaves folded down, it’s small enough to be a good alternative to a folding table when you need extra seating for the holidays—just push it up against the wall and use it as a console, bar, or extra surface area the rest of the time. Size(s) available: 24" x 32" to 48" x 32" More color/finish options: No Extendable: Yes Warren Drop Leaf Dining Table $599 Pottery Barn Round dining tables A marble-top tulip dining table Though it’s been around for more than 60 years, the tulip table is the most iconic modern dining table there is. This less-expensive reproduction mimics Eero Saarinen’s original midcentury design, complete with a real marble top, lacquered for longevity. With a 45-inch diameter, this round marble dining table tucks into a corner or nook to create a stylish dining area anywhere in your home—it would even look really good in a living room—but it can still comfortably seat four for an intimate dinner party. You can pair it with modern chairs or bistro chairs to mix up the look. Size(s) available: 45" Round More color/finish options: No Extendable: No Steve Silver Colfax White Marble Table $859 Macy's A round postmodern dining table If you’ve decided a round dining table is the best fit for your space but your aesthetic is more postmodern than midcentury-modern, this three-legged option will add instant style to any room. It’s made of solid oak with some MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard). While the listed seating capacity is only three, you might be able to squeeze in a few more around the 52-inch tabletop—as long as they don’t mind straddling one of those bulky legs, that is. Size(s) available: 52" Round, 84" x 40" More color/finish options: No Extendable: No Daymon Round Dining Table $2,280 All Modern Oval dining tables An oval tulip dining table For those who have a bigger space to fill (or need to fit more than four chairs) but still want the iconic look of a tulip table, this indoor/outdoor option from Williams-Sonoma is worth consideration (if it’s within your budget). With a concrete oval tabletop and a powder-coated-steel pedestal base, this durable dining table is made to stand up to the elements, but it’s stylish and neutral enough to be the focal point of an indoor dining room too. Size(s) available: 70" x 46" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Tulip 70-Inch Outdoor Concrete Oval Dining Table $2,995 Williams Sonoma An oval solid-wood dining table This statement table from West Elm has clean lines and a minimalist design with a few subtle curves to keep it from feeling too modern. It’s made of kiln-dried mango wood, a durable, sustainable hardwood that resembles teak, but at a much more affordable price. It’s not expandable, but it does come in three sizes (72 inches, 86 inches, and 100 inches), so it can work in medium or large dining rooms. Size(s) available: 72" x 39" More color/finish options: Yes Extendable: No Anton Solid Wood Oval Dining Table $1,499 West Elm What to consider when buying a dining table Size When picking out a table, size is more important than seating capacity. You need to get something that will fit into your dining room or designated dining space and leave enough room to comfortably get in and out of a chair on all sides. Ideally, there would also be room to walk around the table while people are seated on it, but that’s not always an option—especially if you have a small space and you like to host a lot of dinner parties. Shape A round or oval table might provide some extra space, and unless you’re never, ever going to seat more than four people at a time, avoid a square table and opt for a round table with similar dimensions. Leg style Keep in mind that it’s easier to squeeze more people into a rectangular table with a pedestal base or four simple legs than it is to pull an extra chair up to a table with trestle supports, extra crossbars, or bulky legs. Simpler legs or pedestal dining tables also provide more accessibility for guests in a wheelchair. Looking for the best dining room tables for small spaces ? We have a guide to those too.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. Finding the best dining table for your space can seem challenging. After all, there are a lot of factors to consider: size, material, durability, and, most importantly, style. So we chatted with interior designer Maureen Ursino of Ursino Interiors for guidance on choosing what's right for you. "Solid hardwood is always a classic choice for durability and ease of maintenance," she tells House Beautiful . “It is also fairly easy to repair compared to a glass or stone top, making it one of our go-to family-friendly materials." As for the shape of your soon-to-be new table, consider basing your decision on your dining room or eating area. “A round table is best in rooms that are square (or circular!) because it proportionally fills the room and allows for the most seating and circulation space," Ursino adds. With all of this in mind, you’re on the fast track to picking out the perfect piece. Just remember, the best dining tables are the ones you’ll love as long as they last, which should be at least a few years. And unlike a sofa or a rug , dining tables are often designed to withstand quite a bit of wear and tear, so there’s little need to be too cautious when picking out the perfect table for your space.

"I personally love an oval or round dining table because they're great for conversation, take up less space, and provide ample space," interior designer Amanda Jacobs says. "I do believe that the shape of the room can and will determine what's the best shape, though." How do you incorporate a table without a formal dining room? "It's smart to have something versatile that can adjust from day to day," Jacon notes. "So I'd recommend a table with a drop leaf or multiple leaves."

Fashioned from mahogany wood with sapele veneers creating an alluring starburst pattern, its hickory brown finish adds a touch of formal charm to your dining area. As if that weren’t impressive enough, the curvy stainless steel pedestal legs finished in brass makes for a striking contrast to the dark wood tabletop. The table’s size is roomy enough to fit six to eight people, but once you insert the two leaves, you can expand the length to about 116 inches and seat an extra two to four. With a total weight of 198 pounds and a length of 76 inches, this table is quite large and heavy, yet with Ethan Allen’s Premier In-Home delivery, the table will be delivered and assembled right in your home. While we wish this dining table was available in more than one finish, we think its elegant appearance and ample seating capacity will dazzle during any holiday event or cocktail party. It’s also available in a round style, and like the Lark Manor Aldrina Wood Base Dining Table , our best overall pick, the details of the legs add a big dash of pizzazz to an already visually appealing table. Dimensions: 76 x 42 x 30 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Wood, sapele veneers, stainless steel | Seating Capacity: 6 to 8 (10 to 12 with leaves) Best for 4 Crate & Barrel Diset Wood Oval 48" Extendable Dining Table PHOTO: Crate & Barrel $639 at Crate & Barrel What We Like Easy to assemble Sturdy construction Versatile sizing What We Don't Like Potential damage if surface is not protected For those who want a more intimate seating capacity or desire a minimalist style without any embellishment, Crate and Barrel’s Diset Wood Oval Dining Table may be the table for you. Made of white oak, engineered and hard woods and finished in a light dove gray, the straight legs and simple oval design of this table suit many different decor styles. At 48 inches across, it provides a comfortable eating space for four all around, but it’s also versatile. Pop in the leaf, and you can extend it to 66 inches, enough room to seat another two people for a lively brunch or lunch. Keep in mind, though, that assembly is required for this table; however, we like that detailed, illustrated instructions can be found online to make the process a breeze. Though the dining table does require special care, such as avoiding abrasive cleaners and acidic food and drink, you may want to avoid putting anything down on this table without a coaster or trivet to avoid potential puffing. Dimensions: 30 x 48 x 48 inches | Shape: Oval | Material: White oak, hardwood, engineered wood | Seating Capacity: 4 (6 with leaf) Best for 6 Ashley Furniture Isanti Dining Table PHOTO: Ashley Furniture View on Ashleyfurniture.com What We Like Plenty of matching accessories Minimal care and maintenance What We Don't Like Potential stability issue following assembly The Isanti Dining Table is fairly simple in design and function, yet at a length of 72 inches, it’s spacious enough to fit six people comfortably. Made of solid mango wood, its strength is quite similar to cherry and ash, so it has quite a bit of durability that is optimal for those with pets and families. Cleaning it is a breeze, and you don’t need a special cleanser-just a smidge of soap and water and/or wipe with a damp cloth. However, spills need to be taken care of as quickly as possible to avoid water damage. Plus, as part of the Isanti collection, you can pick from a host of matching accessories, such as chairs and benches. While the assembly is fairly straightforward, we found that the alignment and stability of the legs could be a little off, so definitely take some extra time to reinforce the bolts.  When you need a basic table without a lot of fuss and muss, the Isanti Dining Table fits the bill. Dimensions: 72 x 30.13 x 38.88 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Wood | Seating Capacity: 6 Best for 8 Everly Quinn Raydean 79'' Pedestal Dining Table PHOTO: Wayfair $850 at Wayfair What We Like Thick and sturdy tempered glass Stainless steel, metallic finish structure Heat-resistant, anti-oxidizing and anti-rust properties What We Don't Like Multiple people needed to assemble Those seeking a more modern-looking dining room set will adore the Everly Queen Raydean Dining Table. This striking glass-topped table has a beautiful stainless steel pedestal cross base available in either a silver or gold finish, which adds a touch of elegance to your dining room. With space to seat six to eight people, the tempered glass top is heat-resistant, and the legs have anti-oxidizing and anti-rusting properties, so with proper care it will keep gleaming. The table is pretty heavy at 161 pounds, and though assembly is required, it’ll take a team; two or more people are recommended to put this table together due to its weight. The glass is super-thick so you don’t really have to worry too much about any impact causing damage. While this table doesn’t come with chairs, but seating with similar metallic accents will add extra sparkle to your dining area.  If glistening glass and sleek, cool metal are dancing in your thoughts, put the Everly Quinn Raydean Pedestal Dining Table in your shopping cart. Dimensions: 30 x 39.5 x 79 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Glass (top), stainless steel (base) | Seating Capacity: 6 to 8 Best Expandable Pottery Barn Toscana Extending Dining Table PHOTO: Pottery Barn $1,785 at Pottery Barn What We Like Seats up to 8 X-shaped table supports Multiple finishes and sizes What We Don't Like Can’t be exposed to sunlight or extreme temperatures Fashioned from kiln-dried sungkai wood (which has a naturally rough texture and is comparable in durability to mahogany and teak), as well as sungkai veneers and a hand-planed surface, the Pottery Barn Toscana Extending Dining Table gives off an air of rustic, classic beauty.  Available in three different sizes and in five different finishes, the sky's the limit for the type of table you can create. The Toscana’s charm comes from its distressed Italian farmhouse look combined with X-shaped supports. Thanks to the generous extension features of this table, even its smallest size of 60 inches in length can expand to an ample 72 inches with one leaf installed (and a whopping 84 inches with two), so holiday dinners or a grand buffet can be laid out with plenty of room to spare. You will want to ensure this table isn’t exposed to sunlight or extreme temperatures to avoid potential damage, though. While it’s durably constructed with kiln-dried wood, it can see changes to its finish or coloring with these exposures. Though this table is on the expensive side, its appealing style, multiple finish and sizing options, and more-than-generous expansion abilities make it well worth the price, in our opinion. Dimensions: 60 x 38 x 30 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Sungkai wood, veneers | Seating Capacity: 6 to 8 Best for Small Spaces Bassett Furniture Dresden Round Dining Table PHOTO: Bassett Furniture View on Bassettfurniture.com What We Like Versatile, clean Scandinavian design Beautiful pedestal base 3 finishes and 2 sizes available What We Don't Like Can’t be exposed to extreme heat or moisture A smaller space shouldn’t limit your dining table’s style or usefulness, and we think the look of the Dresden Round Dining Table is quite dreamy. This round dining table is fashioned from cherry hardwood with a clean Scandinavian design supported by a beautiful pedestal base, which makes it both lovely and practical in both the kitchen and main dining area. The tabletop is 2 inches thick, so you can feel good about placing heavy objects on it, which is a bonus when accounting for its solid and hefty weight at 218 pounds. We love that the Dresden Round Dining Table comes in three finishes (blonde, dark, and medium), which allows you to select the right shade for your dining room’s style and finishing touches. Though the table isn’t expandable, it is available in both 48-inch and 54-inch sizes, giving you options for up to four people. Plus, we like that there’s no need to worry about assembly; Bassett Furniture’s White Glove delivery service brings it right into your home for effortless setup. As for care and maintenance, you can clean the Dresden Round Dining Table with mild soap and water and dry with a cotton cloth. However, extreme heat is a big no, so you’ll need to always place coasters or trivets under hot items. Overall, with its sturdy construction, simple, yet versatile style, and an ample weight, this table makes a statement: Go small or go home. Dimensions: 30 x 48 x 48 inches | Shape: Round | Material: Wood | Seating Capacity: 2 to 4 Best Farmhouse Pottery Barn Modern Farmhouse Extending Dining Table PHOTO: Pottery Barn $2,399 at Pottery Barn What We Like Sturdy wood design Classic farmhouse design Seats up to 10 What We Don't Like Only dark and light brown finishes available You can capture the farmhouse aesthetic for less with Pottery Barn’s Modern Farmhouse Extending Dining Table. This table’s slightly lower price point is perfect for those who want a durable, well-designed table at a more affordable cost. This sturdy dining table also has a lovely X-shaped base and earthy look. Plus, it’s made with sustainably sourced wood that’s certified by the Forest Stewardship Council , a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving, conserving, and maintaining sustainable forestry. It’s available in only two brown finishes (one dark and one light), which may be somewhat limiting, but we like its impressive construction, which features solid Meranti wood, white oak veneers, and engineered wood. At 94 inches in length, six people can fit around this table, but place the leaf into it and it expands to 112 inches in length and will accommodate up to 10—so big gatherings are an absolute must with this as your dining room’s centerpiece. Dimensions: 94 x 40 x 30 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Solid Meranti wood, engineered wood, white oak veneers | Seating Capacity: 6 (10 with leaf) Best Modern Ivy Bronx Kausar Dining Table PHOTO: Wayfair $680 at Wayfair What We Like Boxy, angular design Steel pedestal bottom Low-maintenance What We Don't Like Only available in white If you enjoy a modern style in your home, the Ivy Bronx Kausar Dining Table may be right up your alley. At an ample 63 inches in length, this rectangular table will fit up to six people, which is more than enough for a cozy dinner. Fashioned from a manufactured wood top, its base is made of the same type of wood, and the steel on the pedestal’s bottom adds more durability and some attractive contrast to the striking white color. That brilliant finish and the boxy, angular design embodies its contemporary style, yet if you're looking for other color choices or shapes, this may not be the one for you. As with many tables offered on Wayfair, assembly is required. The table is easy to clean, so when things get a little messy, wipe and go.  If you want to make a bold statement, don’t just grab this table—a set of equally bold chairs or benches will complete the look. Dimensions: 30 x 35.50 x 63 inches | Shape: Rectangular | Material: Manufactured wood (top), manufactured wood, steel (base) | Seating Capacity: 6 Final Verdict The Lark Manor Andrina Wood Base Dining Table takes our spot for best overall because of its eye-catching design, sturdy construction, and affordability. With its striking table legs, ample seating options, and gorgeous hickory brown-finished mahogany tabletop, our best splurge goes to the Evansview Rectangular Dining Table . When Buying a Dining Room Table, Look for Ample Size and Seating Space As with any piece of furniture, dining room tables come in an assortment of sizes and shapes, including oval, rectangular, square and round. Oval and round tables don’t have sharp corners to bump into and often have a wider surface. Round is ideal for smaller spaces and creating an intimate area, like the Dresden Round Dining Table (our best round pick), while oval- shaped tables such as the Diset Wood Oval 48" Extendable Dining Table (our best for 4 selection) are better for larger groups of people or more narrow rooms . Square and rectangular tables are uniform in shape, which makes them great for when you have to work within very specific room measurements or have to fit a table around existing furniture placement. Like round tables, square ones are great for small groups or for a more intimate setting. Rectangular tables are the most common shape , as they work well for parties of four or more and can fit in a narrow room (we admire the Isanti Dining Table , our best for 6 selection). Before selecting a table, please consider the size of the room it will be placed in, how high you’d like it to be, and how many people will be seated at it. To determine just what size table will be best for your room, take a measurement of the room (or several to be sure). You should also take into account how much space you need around the table to allow for a chair or stool to be pulled in or out, as well as whether you will be able to walk around it comfortably within that area. If you don’t have a lot of space in your dining room, you may want to consider a table that can seat two to four people or one that has removable leaves, which can be added to expand the size of the table when needed and taken out when not. For a particularly small space, a drop-leaf table has the leaves attached to the table on hinges, which can be folded down flatly when not in use. Whether or not a table comes assembled, as for bringing the table into the room itself, you may also want to take the measurement of the width and height of the doorframe you will go through to determine if it will fit. Materials and Construction for Long-Term Durability Be sure to look into the type of material that a table is made out of to determine if it will meet your needs. Hard, sturdy materials such as wood, marble, metal and glass are used for dining room tables, and these surfaces are often very long-lasting with proper care and maintenance. Keep in mind that all material does run a risk of damage with accidents or simple wear and tear. Glass tables can get scratched and possibly crack or shatter. Marble tables are particularly porous and therefore quite susceptible to stains, discoloration, and potential liquid damage. Wooden tables come in hardwood, solid wood, and engineered wood, and may also have veneers to cover the surface. These types of tables should not be exposed to moisture, as warping may occur. According to CraftyCedar , kiln-dried woods are great for tables and other furniture, as the drying process eliminates moisture within the wood, a change that makes it less susceptible to weather changes and, ultimately, less prone to warping or cracking. Active households, such as those with kids and pets, may want to check a table’s care and maintenance guides before purchasing, as some may be especially delicate or sensitive to sunlight or spills. Make sure to always use trivets and coasters to protect tabletop surfaces from heat and liquids. An Eye-Catching Design Along with function, the aesthetics of your dining room table should reflect your personal style and the atmosphere you are setting in that room. Often fashioned out of wood, and employing clean and simple detailing and construction, farmhouse style––like our best farmhouse pick, Pottery Barn’s Modern Farmhouse Extended Dining Table evokes a casual, rustic look. Like farmhouse dining tables, modern style tables often feature clean lines and a smooth symmetry. In addition to wood, dining tables in this style can be made in other materials, such as glass, laminate or marble, like the Ivy Bronx Kausar Dining Table , our best modern pick or the Everly Quinn Raydean 79'' Pedestal Dining Table , our pick for best for 8. If you are into hardware or like how factories look, industrial dining tables often feature a combination of different materials, such as wood and metal. They are often fashioned to look stripped down and unpolished, versus sleek and more elegant styling. Customization Options If you are going the route of having your table custom-made, there are certain aspects you may want to keep in mind in designing the table of your dreams. Dimensions: While most ready-made tables have set dimensions, often custom-made tables will allow you to craft every detail of your ideal table, including length, height, and shape, which comes in handy if your dining room isn’t a perfect quadrilateral. Pedestal-Style Bases: Once you have the dimensions selected, you may also be thinking of the style of legs you would like for your dining table. Pedestal bases are usually one singular and thick piece, with the top and bottom of the base somewhat flared in order to support the weight of the tabletop. Tulip legs, like their namesake flower, have a similar look to pedestal bases, but the center part of the base is somewhat thinner to resemble a tulip’s stem. Table Legs: As for dining tables with four legs, there are several options, with two being somewhat popular. Straight table legs are uniform in shape and width for the whole of the leg, while tapered legs are thicker or wider at the top, and thin out towards the bottom. A Variety of Finishes Many tables will have a finishing option to not only protect the material from daily wear and tear and to avoid occurrences such as splintering, but to add to its beauty and overall appearance. Along with a stain or gloss to prevent scratches, you can even paint your table a vibrant color or have an intricate pattern painted on or etched into the material. Please check with the table manufacturers and craftspeople to determine the best options you have for finishing your table. Why Trust The Spruce?

Fortunately, with plenty of stylish and elevated options on the market, there's no doubt your ideal dining table is just waiting for you to add it to your cart. To help, we curated a guide to the best dining tables of 2024. Whether you're looking to create a cute breakfast nook in your apartment or find a statement piece for a large dining room, there's something for every sized space, and every aesthetic, from modern farmhouse to Scandinavian chic . There are options for all budgets, too, from brands like Amazon, West Elm, Castlery, Wayfair, and more, so keep reading to shop our top picks. But first, we've outlined some details to keep in mind when you're shopping for a dining room table, courtesy of Cameron Johnson, CEO and Founder of the furniture rental company Nickson Living . What to Look For in a Dining Room Table? Johnson recommends using painter's tape to "mark the dimensions of the table you have in mind," noting that "this exercise should give you a sense of how full the space will feel with that particular size table." Likewise, you'll get a feel for whether there's a comfortable amount of space around the table. Pro tip: he recommends grabbing a spare chair from another room to imagine what sitting at the table will be like and how much room there will be when someone pulls a seat out. Smart, right? As for what shape and style to look for, Johnson says you should base this decision on your home's aesthetic and your "room's shape and function." For example, a long rectangular dining table will complement a similarly-shaped room, while a round table can transform small unused square footage into a cozy breakfast nook. Some more ideas? "For more casual dining, one might consider bar-height seating or a picnic table style," he continues, "or a more traditional table with full-backed chairs for formal seating." What Makes a Quality Dining Room Table? Whether a dining table is "quality" is highly subjective, but regarding price tags, a principal determinant is its materials. Generally, "wood is the most popular material, given its sturdiness, resilience, and durability," whereas "polished concrete or stone-topped tables tend to be pricey but very high in quality." More affordable dining room table materials include glass-top designs and those constructed from medium-density fiberboard (MDF), according to Johnson. These are usually less costly to create but likely less durable and long-lasting than the former options. Ready to see our favorite dining tables?
