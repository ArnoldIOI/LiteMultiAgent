seven quarters compared with the first quarterly estimate; however, it is important to note that the typical absolute average revision between the initial quarterly GDP estimate and the estimate three years later is 0.2 percentage points, as there is potential for revision to GDP when the annual supply and use balance occurs as more comprehensive annual data sources are available at a detailed industry and product level; all the GDP growth vintages for these quarters are shown in Table 4.\n Overall the revisions to production reflect:\nrevised volume data from the\xa0Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) for electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply\nnew Value Added Tax (VAT) turnover data for Quarter 2 2023\nnew and revised Monthly Business Survey data\nseasonal adjustment models\nFigure 7: Revisions to production output across 2022 and 2023 are mainly driven by manufacturing; and the electricity, gas and steam subsectors\nConstruction\nConstruction output rose by 0.4% in Quarter 3 2023, revised up from a first estimate increase of 0.1%. Professional, scientific and technical activities: the upward revision in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2022 and Quarter 1 2023 are driven by new and revised survey data within the advertising and market research industry; in Quarter 3 2023, six of the eight industries in this section are revised down, with the largest contribution coming from architecture and engineering activities; technical testing and analysis, because of revised survey data since our last publication and the new VAT data for Quarter 2 2023.\n This review covered:\nprocesses and quality assurance in making revisions to GDP\npotential improvements to early estimates of GDP enabled through enhanced access to data\ncommunication of revisions to GDP, the story behind the most recent set of revisions in particular, and uncertainty in early estimates of GDP\nWe have already started work looking into the recommendations of this review and will set out plans more fully during January 2024.\n Important quality information\nThere are common pitfalls in interpreting data series, and these include:\nexpectations of accuracy and reliability in early estimates are often too high\nrevisions are an inevitable consequence of the trade-off between timeliness and accuracy\nearly estimates are based on incomplete data\nVery few statistical revisions arise as a result of "errors" in the popular sense of the word.'}]
