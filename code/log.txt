            aria-hidden="true"> United Kingdom United Kingdom Overview Editor’s Picks Statistics In 2023, the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom amounted to approximately 2.274 trillion British pounds, compared with 2.27 trillion pounds in 2022, and 2.176 trillion in 2021. Although the UK economy grew in 2023, it has struggled to recover fully from the record 10.4 percent fall in GDP in 2020, which was a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK was not alone in this respect; annual GDP growth rates in Europe falling across the continent in 2020. The UK was the world's sixth-largest economy in 2022, behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and India. As a share of the global economy , however, the UK fell from 2.45 percent in 2018 to 2.21 percent in 2023, with this share expected to fall further in the coming years. UK ends 2023 in recession Although GDP did grow over the whole of year, the UK finished 2023 in a technical recession due to two quarters of negative growth at the end of the year. In Q3 2023, the economy shrank by approximately 0.1 percent, and then by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Despite slightly stronger growth forecast for 2024, and 2025, the UK economy is still struggling from the impact of COVID-19. The UK economy experienced such a severe economic shock in 2020 because it was also one of the worst-affected countries, suffering the highest death toll in Europe . The sudden and extensive lockdown that began at the end of March forced the closure of significant parts of the UK economy, resulting in a record 19.6 percent fall in monthly GDP in April of that year. Although GDP growth returned the following month and reached a record growth rate of 9.7 percent that June, the UK economy was still smaller than pre-pandemic levels. A second wave of the virus gripped the UK throughout the winter, resulting in the reintroduction of some restrictions that had been lifted in the summer. GDP growth slowed and even began to reverse again, with a growth rate of -2.5 percent reported in January 2021. As the UK emerged from this slump, however, positive growth returned, and as of early 2024, the UK economy is slightly larger than it was prior to the pandemic. Characteristics of UK GDP Like many advanced market economies, the United Kingdom is heavily reliant on its service sector , which accounts for over 72 percent of GDP. In terms of gross value added (GVA) , the real estate sector had the highest value of any industry, at over 270 billion pounds, followed by wholesale and retail at over 283.5 billion pounds. On a regional basis, London had a GDP of more than 496.4 billion pounds in 2021 or nearly a quarter of the entire UK economy. When adjusted for GDP per capita, the disparity between London and the UK average was even larger, at 56,431 pounds and 31,947 pounds, respectively. London however, did not have the fastest-growing regional economy in the UK in 2021, with a GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent, compared to the UK average of 7.5 percent, with the fastest growth occurring in the North West, at 9.9 percent.

            aria-hidden="true"> United Kingdom United Kingdom Overview Editor’s Picks Statistics The gross domestic product of the British economy was 2.27 trillion British pounds in 2023 and was the sixth- largest global economy , behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and India. With two quarters of negative growth at the end of 2023, the UK economy is currently in recession, and has grown only slightly compared to its pre-pandemic size. In 2020, UK GDP shrank by a record 10.4 percent due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some ways, the UK economy has successfully recovered from the sudden shock of the pandemic. An annual GDP growth rate of 8.7 percent was recorded in 2021, while the labor market bounced back very strongly, with very low levels of unemployment in 2022.
The inflation rate , by contrast, increased rapidly towards the end of 2021 and reached a 41-year high of 11.1 percent in October 2022. Inflation eases but cost of living crisis continues into 2024 Although inflation remained in double figures for several months after the October 2022 peak, by the end of 2023, it had fallen to four percent. Additionally, since June 2023, wages have begun to grow again, following 20 months of inflation outpacing wage growth. Despite this, as of January 2024, almost half of UK households were still reporting that their cost of living had increased in the last month. This was however down from 91 percent in April 2022, when the average annual energy bill for a typical home in the UK rose significantly due to the energy cap (which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy) increasing in that month with a further rises in 2022 and 2023. Due to these factors real household disposable income fell in 2022/23 and 2023/24, with a further decline expected in 2024/25. It is unclear how long this crisis will last, although the annual inflation rate is expected to fall to 2.2 percent in 2024, and then 1.5 percent in 2025. GDP is forecast to grow by 0.8 percent, in 2024 while unemployment will continue to remain reasonably low, at 4.4 percent. Coronavirus devastates UK economy in 2020 In early 2020, the UK government moved swiftly to mitigate the economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic by furloughing workers and protecting the incomes of the self-employed , its handling of the public health crisis was much less assured, and the country suffered a very high number of deaths in the initial wave as a result. In April 2020, the GDP of the UK fell by 18.9 percent, the biggest monthly fall in GDP ever recorded. Unemployment claims , which numbered 1.23 million before the pandemic, increased to 2.62 million by May. As Summer arrived, there were estimated to be just 343 thousand job vacancies , compared with 796 thousand before lockdown measures started. With cases falling, some parts of the UK economy began to open up, with the government providing aid to the ailing restaurant industry through the ' Eat out to Help Out ' scheme. The end of summer coincided with the arrival of the second wave of the pandemic just as the government's trade negotiations with the European Union began to enter troubled waters. Although an agreement was eventually reached and ratified just before the end of the transition period, the arrangement has left the UK economically isolated from the rest of the continent.
