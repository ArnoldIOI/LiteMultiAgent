In our exploration of building multi-agent systems, we have investigated AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, and MetaGPT, but failed to find a multi-agent system that intuitively makes multi-agent systems more efficient. We have found that most examples provided by these frameworks could be accomplished with just one agent. We reimplemented the multi-agent examples using only one agent with a set of self-defined tools. However, we then realized that this system is not scalable when we have more and more tools. But if we can categorize the agents with different sets of tools into categories, then we are building a hierarchy of agents, where we could accomplish more types of tasks. At the same time, because of this design, the execution of sub-agents is naturally parallelized by parallel function calling, since agents use sub-agents as tools.


## üì∞ News
* [2024-09-28] We refactored LiteMultiAgent into a flexible hierarchical multi-agent framework, adding ToolRegistry, AgentFactory, and AgentManager. This allows users to register their own base tools and create their own agent hierarchies.
* [2024-08-06] We released the initial version of LiteMultiAgent, which is an example of a hierarchical multi-agent system. The agent is able to accomplish a wide range of tasks.

## ‚úàÔ∏è 1. Getting Started

### (1) Installation
From PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/litemultiagent/
```
pip install litemultiagent 
```

Set up locally
First set up virtual environment, and allow your code to be able to see 'litemultiagent'
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
Then please create a .env file, and update your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### (Optional) Supabase Database Set Up
If you want to save log to Supabase. Set up a Supabase project and retrieve the database URL from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[PROJECT_NAME]/settings/database.

The DATABASE_URL follows: postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>. You can get this from Project Settings -> Database -> Connection string.

Save this URL in the .env file as SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL. Then, run:

```bash
python supabase_db_setup.py
```
This will create the multiagent table in your database



### (2) Quickstart
After configuring your API keys, you can run main.py, where the sub-agents are already parallelized through parallel function calling.
```bash
python litemultiagent/main.py
```
TODO: add parallel function calling
